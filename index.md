I am a master student at [*Karadeniz Technical University*](https://www.ktu.edu.tr/en), majoring High Energy and Plasma Physics. Now working my thesis, conserning general neutirno interactions with nucleus coherently under supervision of Assoc. Prof. [Mehmet Demirici](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55795250300). I finished my bachelor at Hasanuddin University with supervision of Prof. [Tasrief Surungan](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=12793289800) with thesis  topic electron-proton deep inelastic scattering in the quakr-parton model. While working my bachelor thesis, I did a short course for deepening my research skill with guidence of Dr. [Julio](scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=36337522200). Other than HEP, others are interest me such as mathematical and computational physics.  Have a look at my conducted and ongoing <a href="/works">works.</a>
