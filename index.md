# Selam!
I am a master student at [*Karadeniz Technical University*](https://www.ktu.edu.tr/en), majoring High Energy and Plasma Physics. Now working my thesis, concerning general neutirno interactions with nucleus coherently under supervision of Assoc. Prof. [Mehmet Demirici](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55795250300). The phenomena provides the highest measurable quantity of process involving neutrino and can be observed in relatively low energy. It can open new paradigms of studying neutrino interaction with matter or even the mysterious dark matter. I finished my bachelor at Hasanuddin University with supervision of Prof. [Tasrief Surungan](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=12793289800) with thesis  topic electron-proton deep inelastic scattering in the quakr-parton model. While working my bachelor thesis, I did a short course for deepening my research skill with guidence of Dr. [Julio](scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=36337522200). Other than HEP, others are interest me such as mathematical and computational physics.  Have a look at my conducted and ongoing [works](/works).
