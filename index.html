title: A Phenomenologist

<h1>May peace be upon you!</h1>
<p>
  I just finished my master at <a href="https://www.ktu.edu.tr/en"><em>Karadeniz Technical University</em></a>. 
  In my thesis, I studied effect of general neutirno interactions within coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering under supervision of 
  <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55795250300">Mehmet Demirici</a>. The phenomena provides the highest measurable 
  quantity of process involving neutrino and can be observed in relatively low energy. The process can open new paradigms of understanding neutrino 
  interactions with matter in low energy region.

  I finished my bachelor at Hasanuddin University under 
  supervision of <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=12793289800">Tasrief Surungan</a>, working on electron-proton 
  deep inelastic scattering in the quark-parton model. While working my bachelor thesis, I did a short course for deepening my research skill 
  under guidence of <a href="scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=36337522200"> Julio</a>. Other than HEP, mathematical and computational physics 
  are also interst me. Now, I am in a state of connecting what I've been found so far with other branch that may emerging practical benefit in society.

  Have a look at what I recently <a href="/blog">contemplated</a>
</p>

<blockquote><p>The past is an interpretation. The future is on illusion. The world does not move through time as if it were a straight line, 
 proceeding from the past to the future. Instead, time moves through and within us, in endless spirals. Eternity does not mean infinite time, 
 but simply timelessness. If you want to experience eternal illumination, put the past and the future out of your mind and remain within 
  the present moment. - Shams Tabrizi</p></blockquote>
