topic electron-proton deep inelastic scattering in the quakr-parton model. While working my bachelor thesis, I did a short course for deepening my research skill with guidence of 
Dr. <a href="scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=36337522200">Julio</a>. Other than HEP, others are interest me such as mathematical and computational physics.
