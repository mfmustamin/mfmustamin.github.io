<h1>May peace be upon you!</h1>

<p>
  Have a look at what I recently <a href="/blog">contemplated</a>
</p>

<blockquote><p>The past is an interpretation. The future is on illusion. The world does not move through time as if it were a straight line, 
 proceeding from the past to the future. Instead, time moves through and within us, in endless spirals. Eternity does not mean infinite time, 
 but simply timelessness. If you want to experience eternal illumination, put the past and the future out of your mind and remain within 
  the present moment. - Shams Tabrizi</p></blockquote>
