<h1> Selam!</h1>
<p>
  I am a master student at <a href="https://www.ktu.edu.tr/en"><em>Karadeniz Technical University</em></a>, majoring High Energy and Plasma Physics. 
  Now working my thesis, concerning general neutirno interactions with nucleus coherently under supervision of 
  Assoc. Prof. <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55795250300">Mehmet Demirici</a>. The phenomena provides the highest measurable 
  quantity of process involving neutrino and can be observed in relatively low energy. This process can open new paradigms of understanding neutrino 
  interactions with matter, or even the mysterious dark matter. I finished my bachelor at Hasanuddin University under 
  supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=12793289800">Tasrief Surungan</a> on electron-proton 
  deep inelastic scattering in the quark-parton model. While working my bachelor thesis, I did a short course for deepening my research skill 
  under guidence of Dr. <a href="scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=36337522200"> Julio</a>. Other than HEP, mathematical and computational physics 
  are also interst me.  Have a look at my conducted and ongoing <a href="/works">works</a>.

<blockquote><p>The past is an interpretation. The future is on illusion. The world does not move through time as if it were a straight line, 
 proceeding from the past to the future. Instead, time moves through and within us, in endless spirals. Eternity does not mean infinite time, 
 but simply timelessness. If you want to experience eternal illumination, put the past and the future out of your mind and remain within 
  the present moment. - Shams Tabrizi</p></blockquote>
