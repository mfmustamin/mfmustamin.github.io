<h1>About</h1>
<p> 
 I just finished my master at <a href="https://www.ktu.edu.tr/en"><em>Karadeniz Technical University</em></a>. 
 In my thesis, I studied effect of general neutirno interactions within coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering under supervision of 
 <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55795250300">Mehmet Demirici</a>. The phenomena provides the highest measurable 
 quantity of process involving neutrino and can be observed in relatively low energy. The process can open new paradigms of understanding neutrino 
 interactions with matter in low energy region.

 I finished my bachelor at Hasanuddin University under 
 supervision of <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=12793289800">Tasrief Surungan</a>, working on electron-proton 
 deep inelastic scattering in the quark-parton model. While working my bachelor thesis, I did a short course for deepening my research skill 
 under guidence of <a href="scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=36337522200"> Julio</a>. Other than HEP, mathematical and computational physics 
 are also interst me. Now, I am in a state of connecting what I've been found so far with other branch that may emerging practical benefit in society.
